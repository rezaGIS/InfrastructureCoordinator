    <p>
        Colorado experienced widespread, unprecedented flooding in September of 2013 that ravaged 24 counties and tore apart lives, homes, businesses and communities across the state -– resulting in damages of nearly $4 billion.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an immediate response to the floods, Gov. John Hickenlooper formed the Colorado Recovery Office (CRO) to coordinate
        recovery efforts, provide transparency, maintain a sense of urgency at the state level, advocate for recovery funding and build partnerships across multi-faceted public and private organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
        While initially focusing its efforts toward infrastructure repairs, watershed restoration activities and the immediate needs of the tens of thousands of Coloradans who were personally impacted by event, the mission of the office eventually began to also encompass and transition toward resiliency planning, development and implementation for the long term.
    </p>
    <p>
        To reflect its expanded mission, the Governor renamed the CRO as the Colorado Resiliency and Recovery Office (CRRO) in 2015, which holds the dual responsibility of continuing its recovery oversight mission, along with spearheading the long-term implementation of the State’s holistic resiliency efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CRRO continues to work with local communities in a variety of efforts to both resolve outstanding and ongoing issues resulting from 2013 events and beyond, as well as educating and inspiring communities to become more resilient and prepared for future disasters and hardships.
    </p>
    <p>
        In short, the CRRO’s mission is to help empower Colorado communities in building stronger, safer and more resilient in the face of natural disasters and other major challenges. CRRO coordinates overarching recovery and resiliency activities by collaborating with numerous multi-disciplinary local, state, federal and private partners in setting priorities, leveraging resources, communicating transparently and delivering measurable results to shape an adaptable and vibrant future.
