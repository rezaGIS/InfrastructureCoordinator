# Details
This application was created for the Colorado Resiliency Working Group.  The main purpose of this application was to find infrastructure data that other State Agencies had out in the public.
One of the painpoints for the group was having to collect and update shapefiles that contained this information so they could coordinate their projects.
The solution to this was to have the application rely on already existing Map Services created by the agencies and for the application to query whether they existed and provide
contact information for the user to follow up on if they needed more concrete data.
